          <h3  >Daily Rental</h3>
          <p>
            Daily rental is a great way to get acquainted with a car before
            buying or committing to a long-term rental. You can rent a car for
            one day with the option to extend the contract at a favorable price.

          <h3  >Weekly Rental</h3>
          <p>
            Planning a vacation or business trip to Dubai? Then renting a car
            for a week or more at a special price is your choice! Renting a car
            is much more cost-effective than taking taxis and allows you to
            enjoy all the attractions of Dubai.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3  >Monthly Rental</h3>
          <p>
            An economy car or a luxurious SUV with a monthly rental becomes more
            advantageous and allows you to enjoy your trip or business visit.
            Renting a car for a month allows you to pick it up right at the
            airport and return it at any convenient location.
