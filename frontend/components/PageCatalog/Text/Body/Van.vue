            Renting a VAN in Dubai provides several advantages, particularly if
            you are traveling with your family or friends. Choosing a VAN over a
            usual car is beneficial in several cases, when you have specific
            needs or circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-information__ul">
            <li class="text-information__li">
              <strong>Traveling with a large group</strong>
              <br />
              If you are with a family, friends, or a team, VANs can accommodate
              more passengers comfortably compared to a standard car. This is
              perfect for any group outings, family vacations, or corporate
              events.
            </li>
            <li class="text-information__li">
              <strong>Carrying huge luggage or equipment</strong>
              <br />
              VANs offer significantly more cargo space, which makes them
              suitable for transporting large items. You can carry things such
              as sports gear, equipment, or substantial amounts of luggage,
              which does not fit in a usual taxi. This is particularly useful
              for trips involving a lot of gear or shopping.
            </li>
            <li class="text-information__li">
              <strong>Extended Road Trips</strong>
              <br />
              For long-distance travel, VAMs provide more space for passengers
              to stretch out and have a more comfortable journey. With more
              seating and storage, everyone can travel more comfortably on
              extended trips.
            </li>
            <li class="text-information__li">
              <strong>Moving or Delivery</strong>
              <br />
              VAN provides the necessary cargo space to handle furniture, boxes,
              or other items that wouldnâ€™t fit in a regular car. It can be
              useful when you move to another place and need extra space for
              your luggage.
